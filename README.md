## Overview

This **Project Management Website** is designed to streamline the management of projects within a software engineering department or college. It provides an end-to-end solution for the project lifecycle, from creation to final evaluation. The system caters to both students, who can apply for projects, and project providers, who can post and manage their projects. It also includes functionality for randomly assigning judges to projects to ensure unbiased evaluations.

## Features

- **Project Posting and Management**: Project providers can create, update, and manage project listings.
- **Student Applications**: Students can browse available projects and apply to those that match their interests.
- **Judge Assignment**: The system randomly assigns judges to projects to maintain impartiality during evaluations.
- **Project Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitor the progress of projects from inception to completion.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Version Control**: Git

The Student Submission Page allows students to manage their project submissions after a submission period is opened. Students can upload required files for grading, delete them if needed, or request permission to submit multiple files. Once evaluated, students can view their grades and instructor feedback directly on this page, along with an anonymized distribution of all projects' grades for comparison. The interface displays submission status, and date information, and provides clear navigation controls for a streamlined submission experience.

## Advisor Submission Status View

The Advisor Submission Status View allows project advisors to monitor student submission progress for all projects under their supervision. Advisors can track which submissions are open, download student files before deadlines to provide timely feedback, and view grades assigned to each submission. 

## Judge Submission Review Page
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40ba7679-8875-4a68-afc4-f60a3d7e8621)

The Judge Submission Review Page provides evaluators with access to student submissions after the submission deadline has passed. Judges can download and review all submitted files, enter grades, and provide detailed feedback for each project submission. The interface indicates submission details and allows judges to modify their evaluations until grades are officially published by the coordinator, creating an efficient and intuitive grading workflow.

## Project Management Dashboard
