## Project Overview
This Project Management Website is designed to streamline the management of projects within the software engineering department or college. It provides an end-to-end solution for project lifecycle management, from project creation to final evaluation. The system caters to both students, who can apply for projects, and project providers, who can post and manage their projects. Additionally, it includes functionality for assigning judges to projects randomly for unbiased evaluations.
